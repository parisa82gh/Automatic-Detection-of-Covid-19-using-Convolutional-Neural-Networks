# Automatic-Detection-of-Covid-19-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In this project, we aimed at enabling automatic prediction of COVID-19 using convolutional neural network (CNN) models. For this purpose, we have used AlexNet, Squeeznet, ResNet18, ResNet34, VGG16 and EfficientNetB4 pre- trained models. The ternary classifies the images into three classes, as COVID-19 positive, viral pneumonia and normal.
To perform ternary classification, we have worked with the COVID-19 RADIOGRAPHY DATABASE available at https://kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database . We used the models AlexNet, Squeeznet, ResNet18, ResNet34, VGG16 to classify the images in this database.
